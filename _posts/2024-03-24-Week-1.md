Semaine 1 de mon programme de sport

Week 1 of My Fitness Program

Hello everyone,

I wanted to talk about getting back into exercise. Indeed, it had been almost nine months since I had hardly run at all. I decided to get back into sports and create a real training program for myself. Firstly, because I wanted to gradually get back into it after such a long period of inactivity, and also because I wanted to improve my lifestyle and physical condition over the long term.
It's been a week since I resumed sports and I've managed to run for 1 hour and 10 minutes over 3 sessions! For a comeback, I'm pretty proud of myself, and I hope to continue at this pace.

Firstly, I wanted to talk about my method. I asked ChatGPT to provide a training program to run a half-marathon, and here is its response:

It's fantastic that you're interested in running! A half-marathon is an ambitious challenge but entirely achievable with proper preparation. Here is a basic 16-week training program for a beginner runner. It's based on 4 training sessions per week:

Before starting, make sure to consult a healthcare professional to ensure you're fit to embark on this type of physical training.

During the last week, reduce the intensity of your workouts. Running a half-marathon is exhausting, so it's important to approach the race feeling rested and healthy. Make sure to eat nutritious foods and stay well-hydrated throughout the program.

This suggested program is very basic. You might want to join a training group or hire a personal trainer for a more personalized and specific program to your own needs.

Also, remember to properly recover after your workouts; sleep is a key element of recovery. Moreover, stretching can help prevent injuries, so take the time to stretch at the end of your sessions.

Don't forget: your body needs time to adjust to a new effort, don't push too hard, and most importantly, listen to yourself, don't go beyond your comfort limits.

Pretty good, right?

So I embarked on this journey, and I must say that for this first week, my legs are heavy the day after training, but no joint or muscle pain. However, the most significant benefit I've felt is mentally. After training, my brain seems clearer, and I feel sharper intellectually.
Right after training, I feel euphoric thanks to the endorphin rush. And throughout the week, I've felt less stressed. Just for that, I need to continue!
